### Employ Python's replace function to replace each period character "." contained within the IP address with a period character bounded by opening and closing square brackets "[.]".

``` python
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
        return address.replace(".", "[.]")
```

### Create an output string. For every character within the IPv4 address supplied, either append to the output string that character or "[.]" should the character at that position be a period.

``` python
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
        output = ""
        
        for char in address:
            if char != ".":
                output += char
            else:
                output += "[.]"
                
        return output
```

This can be rewritten to employ a ternary operator:

``` python
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
        output = ""
        
        for char in address:
            output += char if char != "." else "[.]"
                
        return output
```


This can be further rewritten to employ Python list comprehension:

``` python
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
        return "".join([char if char != "." else "[.]" for char in address])
```
