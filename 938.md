A binary search tree (BST) is a form of rooted binary tree. Each node within a binary tree has an associated payload and references to the root node of any right or left subtrees at that point. To be classed as a search tree, every node N within a binary tree must satisfy the constraint that any payload contained within any left subtree must be less than the value of the payload of node N (according to some specified metric) and, conversely, that any payload contained within any right subtree must exceed the value of the payload of node N.

A binary search tree can be implemented as follows:

``` python
class TreeNode:
  def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
    self.val = val
    self.left = left
    self.right = right
```

Owing to ordered nature of nodes within a binary search tree, the elements contained can be visited in order of increasing payload value by recursively expanding the tree as follows (where root is the root node of the binary search tree):

``` python
def inorder_traversal(root: TreeNode) -> None:
    
    if root.left:
        inorder_traversal(root.left)
    
    print(root.val)    
    
    if root.right:
        inorder_traversal(root.right)
        
inorder_traversal(root) 
```

Given such a binary search tree, to determine the sum of the values between a lower-bound L and an upper-bound R, a variant of this algorithm can be employed:

``` python
class Solution:
    def rangeSumBST(self, root: TreeNode, L: int, R: int) -> int:
        sum = 0
        
        if L <= root.val <= R:
            sum += root.val
        
        if root.left:
            sum += self.rangeSumBST(root.left, L, R)   
    
        if root.right:
            sum += self.rangeSumBST(root.right, L, R)
            
        return sum
```

This can be rewritten to only expand daughter-subtrees which may contain values within the range L through R - this is achieved by pruning branches whose maximum value is less than L or whose minimum value is greater than R: 

``` python
class Solution:
    def rangeSumBST(self, root: TreeNode, L: int, R: int) -> int:
        sum = 0
        
        if L <= root.val <= R:
            sum += root.val
        
        if root.left and root.val >= L:
            sum += self.rangeSumBST(root.left, L, R)   
    
        if root.right and root.val <= R:
            sum += self.rangeSumBST(root.right, L, R)
            
        return sum
```
