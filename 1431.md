### Determine the number of candies held by the child who has the most candies. For each child, determine if the sum of the number of candies held by that child and the number of extra candies is equal to, or exceeds, the maximal number of candies previously held by any child.

``` python
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        most_candies = max(candies)
        
        for i, no_candies in enumerate(candies):
            if (no_candies + extraCandies) >= most_candies:
                candies[i] = True
            else:
                candies[i] = False
        
        return candies
```

### Determine the number of candies any child must currently have such that, given they recieve all of the extra candies, they have the most candies. For each child, determine if the number of candies held by that child meets, or exceeds, that figure.

``` python
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        candies_to_beat = max(candies) - extraCandies
        
        for i, no_candies in enumerate(candies):
            if no_candies >= candies_to_beat:
                candies[i] = True
            else:
                candies[i] = False
        
        return candies
```

This can be rewritten to employ a ternary operator:

``` python
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        candies_to_beat = max(candies) - extraCandies
        
        for i, no_candies in enumerate(candies):
            candies[i] = True if no_candies >= candies_to_beat else False
        
        return candies
```

This can be further rewritten to employ Python list comprehension:

``` python
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        candies_to_beat = max(candies) - extraCandies
        return [True if no_candies >= candies_to_beat else False for no_candies in candies]
```
