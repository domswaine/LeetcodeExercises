### Iterate through the balanced string provided as input, maintaining a running count of the number of "L" and "R" characters observed to that point. Where the number of "L" and "R" characters are equal, a new balanced string (a substring of the balanced string provided as input) can be formed.

``` python
class Solution:
    def balancedStringSplit(self, s: str) -> int:
        no_balanced_strings = 0
        counts = {"L": 0, "R": 0}
        
        for char in s:
            counts[char] += 1
            
            if counts["L"] == counts["R"]:
                no_balanced_strings += 1
                
        return no_balanced_strings
```
